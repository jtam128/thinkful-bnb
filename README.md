# Thinkful-bnb
This is a project I created while attending Thinkful's Software Engineering Bootcamp. While working on this project, I practiced following a mobile-first approach to web development through the use of media queries and flexbox layouts. As a result, I was able to create a responsive website that can be viewed via desktop and mobile. I also practiced writing code in HTML to create different form input types.

Thinkful-bnb is a mock vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale. It is not a fully functional website and was created in order to practice mobile-first development.
